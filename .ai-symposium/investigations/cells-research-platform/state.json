  "original_question": "How should the Cells home page pitch reflect the expanded research platform vision? What architecture supports extensible surveys? What should the sprint backlog prioritize? Should topology be prioritized earlier?",
  "clarified_scope": "Cells is a research database of systematically surveyed cellular automata, with multi-pass extensible analysis, designed to understand how universe structure (topology, tiling, neighborhood) affects emergent complexity. Roadmap: v0.1 = Survey Explorer (4 sprints), v0.2 = Research Platform with extensible metrics (3 sprints), v0.3 = Topology Explorer (3 sprints).",

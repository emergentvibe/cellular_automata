      "proponents": ["Wolfram", "Kay"],
      "argument": "Extensibility is core to the research platform vision. Without it, v0.1 is just a browser, not a laboratory. Users should be able to define new metrics from day one."

      "stance": "Defer extensibility to v0.2",
      "proponents": ["Brooks", "Rams"],
      "argument": "Validate the core survey explorer first. Extensibility adds complexity (sandboxing, security, UX). Ship v0.1 minimal, gather feedback, then add extensibility in v0.2 if users want it."
    },
    "resolution": "Defer to v0.2, but acknowledge extensibility vision in v0.1 home page pitch. v0.1 ships with 4-5 built-in metrics (lambda, gamma, dimension, period). v0.2 adds metrics SDK. Data model supports both from day one (versioned metrics structure).",
    "status": "resolved",
    "implications": "v0.1 timeline stays at 6-8 weeks. Home page must clearly state 'research platform' vision even though extensibility isn't live yet. Risk: users might not return for v0.2 if v0.1 doesn't deliver extensibility promise."

      "stance": "Explain computational irreducibility",
      "proponents": ["Wolfram"],
      "argument": "Computational irreducibility is the epistemological foundation. It explains WHY we need to survey (can't predict which rules are interesting). Users should understand this."

    "position_b": {
      "stance": "Keep home page simple, link to depth",
      "proponents": ["Rams", "Brooks"],
      "argument": "Home page should hook users, not teach theory. 'Computational irreducibility' is jargon. Lead with wonder (animations), explain method (survey), reveal vision (emergence). Link to 'About the Research' for deep explanation."
    },
    "resolution": "Simple home page with 4 sections: Hero (animation), The Space (262k rules), The Method (survey), The Vision (emergence). Add 'About the Research' link to separate page with computational irreducibility, topology effects, hierarchical emergence, etc.",

    "implications": "Home page appeals to wider audience (explorers + scientists). Scientists click 'About the Research' for depth. Casual users skip theory, dive into Atlas. Progressive disclosure."

      "proponents": ["Brooks", "Rams"],
      "argument": "Don't build what you don't need yet. v0.1 only has flat-torus rules. Adding topology/tiling fields now is premature. Wait until v0.3 when we actually survey other topologies."
    },
    "resolution": "Include topology/tiling/neighborhood fields in v0.1 schema. All 22,590 existing rules get topology='flat-torus', tiling='square', neighborhood='moore'. This is cheap (just extra columns), future-proof (no migration needed for v0.3), and honest (makes universe structure explicit).",
    "status": "resolved",
    "implications": "v0.1 schema is slightly more complex, but migration-free. Users see topology='flat-torus' in Detail page, which educates them that topology is variable (even though only one value exists initially). v0.3 can add sphere/hex rules without schema changes."

    "resolution": "Use WebWorker sandbox with constraints: 30s timeout, no network, no DOM, read-only rule data. Provide standard utils API (simulate, detectPattern, etc). Require testing on 10 sample rules before queuing full run. Monitor for abuse, add restrictions if needed.",
    "status": "resolved",
    "implications": "v0.2 security model is sandbox + constraints, not restriction. Users can write powerful metrics (glider detection, hierarchy classification) but can't harm system. Trade-off: sophisticated users might hit time/capability limits. Can expand sandbox capabilities in v0.3 if needed."

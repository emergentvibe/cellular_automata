# Expert Selection - Panel 01 (Exploration)

## Question Being Investigated

**Original:** How should the Cells home page pitch be rewritten to reflect the expanded vision? What architecture supports extensible surveys? How should the sprint backlog change?

**Expanded Vision:** Cells is not just a CA browser - it's a **research platform** where:
- Users can add new metrics (extensible surveys)
- Multi-pass analysis creates a layered filtering/analysis pipeline
- Fundamental variables (topology, locality, grid tiling) are first-class
- Goal is to find amazing CAs AND understand how universe rules affect emergence

## Panel Type: Exploration

Need to map the territory of this expanded vision:
- What does "extensible surveys" mean architecturally?
- What's the right mental model for "layered analysis"?
- How do we balance "find cool CAs" vs "fundamental research"?
- What should the home page communicate?
- How does this change the roadmap?

## Expert Selection (7 experts)

### Foundational Thinkers (2)
1. **Stephen Wolfram** - He's the CA research pioneer. A New Kind of Science is all about systematic exploration of rule spaces to find emergence. He'll ground us in the research tradition and push for computational irreducibility insights.

2. **Gregory Bateson** - Patterns, systems thinking, "patterns on patterns." He'll help us think about emergence hierarchies and what it means to study how universe rules affect complexity.

### Domain Specialists (3)
3. **Bret Victor** - Interactive exploration, "Explorable Explanations." He'll push for the UI to be a thinking tool, not just a database viewer. Extensibility should empower discovery.

4. **Alan Kay** - "Personal computing," "Computer as medium." He'll think about Cells as a research medium, not a research tool. What does it mean for users to extend the metrics?

5. **Rich Hickey** - Data-first thinking, extensibility through data. He'll push for metrics-as-data, analysis-as-composition. How do you make a system that grows without breaking?

### Systems/Architecture (1)
6. **Fred Brooks** - Conceptual integrity, second-system effect. He'll warn about over-engineering while acknowledging the vision is bigger than v0.1. How do we get there incrementally?

### Critic (1)
7. **Dieter Rams** - "Less, but better." He'll challenge whether this expanded vision is coherent or just feature creep. Is this still one thing, or three things pretending to be one?

## Expected Tensions

- **Wolfram vs Kay/Victor:** Wolfram will want systematic exhaustive search. Kay/Victor will want playful, creative exploration. Different modes for different goals.

- **Hickey vs Brooks:** Hickey will want to design for extensibility now. Brooks will warn about second-system effect. How much future-proofing is wise?

- **Rams vs everyone:** Rams will question whether "extensible metrics" and "topology support" and "layered analysis" belong in the same system. Is this conceptual integrity or feature bloat?

## What I Hope to Learn

1. **Mental model:** What IS this system? "CA research platform" is vague. Is it a database? A computational lab? A discovery tool?

2. **Architecture implications:** If users can add metrics, what does that mean? Plugins? Scripts? Data columns? Code?

3. **Roadmap changes:** Does this vision mean v0.1 was too conservative? Or should we ship v0.1 and add this in v0.2-0.5?

4. **Home page:** How do we pitch this to researchers vs casual explorers? Is there one audience or two?

5. **What's core:** Topology support, extensible metrics, layered analysis - which is essential for the vision, which is nice-to-have?
